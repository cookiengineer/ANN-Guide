# Evolutionary AI Workshop

This Evolutionary AI workshop focusses on a live-coding
experience while forcing the participant out of their
comfort zone in order to implement an AI simulation
(or at least the parts that matter) from scratch.

The workshop will lead to a parallelized, scalable
Evolutionary Reinforcement Learning Pong Game that
can be run inside the moden Web Browser.


## Requirements

`node.js` preferred to serve a correct web server.
Alternatively either `python3` or `python2` (which
is automatically used as fallback as a web server).

`bash` as shell in order to start the `bin/serve.sh`.
On Windows, use the `git bash` aka `git for Windows`.

[Google Chrome](https://google.com/chrome) or any
other Blink web browser in order to use their Dev Tools.

Text editor or Code IDE of your choice (I don't give
a damn tbh). If you don't know what that is, install
`Visual Studio Code`.


## Usage

Navigate to this folder in the `bash` shell and execute
the `./bin/serve.sh` script that will spawn a web server
on [localhost:1337](http://localhost:1337/index.html).
