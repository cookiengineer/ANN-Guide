# Cookie Engineer's Talks

I created this Repository just for the sake of easyness.

I'm lazy and I kind of hated "wasted" Repositories, so
this is kind of the new collection of talks that I do
from time to time.

Slides are written in a subset of CommonMark, so the
`./bin/generate.sh` part requires node.js installed to
function properly. The `./bin/serve.sh` just calls the
generator and then serves stuff via python's http.server
or (if on old Macbook) via SimpleHTTPServer.
