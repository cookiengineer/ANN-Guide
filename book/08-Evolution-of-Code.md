## Meta Talk

- Evolutionary AI guy
- "Ghetto AI" creator
- lychee.js Engine
- artificial.engineering

## Meta Talk

I prefer backpropagated ES/HyperBNEAT
over everything (including sleep), but
this is an Absolute Beginner-Level talk.

## Disclaimer

- I am a practical AI guy
- I use backpropagated and instincted ES/HyperBNEAT
- I love automated labor
- I hate manual labor
- I also do hate maths and doctors

## Disclaimer

I tend to say fuck a lot.
At least I'm honest about it.

## Genetic Programming

- Idea is to represent data as DNA
- DNA can be combined with others
- Imagine DNA as an "Array of values"
- Values can also be weights of an NN :)

## Genetic Programming

## Evolution Basics

- Evolution has three phases
- Phase 1 is Training
- Phase 2 is Evaluation
- Phase 3 is Breeding

## Evolution Basics

![evolution](/asset/evolution.png)

## Evolution Basics

- After each Epoche / Cycle:
- Population gets killed and replaced
- Some of them are Mutants
- Some of them are Survivors
- Only the best ones get to breed

## Evolution Basics

## Evolution Basics

- Always a Multi-Agent system
- Always a competitive environment
- Agent gets rewarded or punished
- Agent has fitness as status
- Fittest agents get to breed/multiply


= NEAT

# NEAT

## NEAT

- Neuro Evolution of Augmenting Topologies
- Adaptive neural network algorithm
- builds neural networks from scratch

## NEAT

- learns how to build ANNs
- learns the behaviour of ANNs
- learns the performance of ANNs

## NEAT

- is technically an unsupervised system
- adapts to new problems and datasets
- understands relations of problems and solutions
- remembers solutions in the form of DNA (genes)


= Network

# Network

## Network

- Neural Network is adaptive
- Per-Neuron graph structure
- Neurons have multiple connections
- Connections have weights

## Network

![adaptive-nn](/asset/adaptive-nn.png)

## Network

- is not data-specific
- only requires input matrix / input array
- bias neuron is an "always on" node

= Genome

# Genome

## Genome

Idea is to represent a neural network
in the form of DNA, so that it can be
measured, tracked, enhanced and advanced
using breeding mechanisms.

## Genome

- represents mutations
- measured via innovation count
- has fitness and adjusted fitness
- has multiple genes

## Gene

- one gene is one neuron connection
- can be enabled (dominant)
- can be disabled (recessive)
- is also weighted
- (weight can be backpropagated)

## Gene

# In Practice

## In Practice

- good at explorative search space
- good at finding unknown solutions
- good at combinations of existing knowledge
- can be seen as decision tree automation


## Automation Idea

- everybody writes unit tests
- unit tests are bad
- behavioural tests are good
- automate relations between tests and code
